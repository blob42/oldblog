This is my fresh new blog, I finally decided to use [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) 
and [github](http://pages.github.com/)

I like knowing that I have access to a full revision history to my blog, and be able 
to deploy it any where I can serve static files. Best of all, I can write my posts using my favorite 
text editor, VIM :).

By the way, I have also decided to start writing more often about stuff. 
It's a special time in my life, I am currently working with a great team on great ideas, 
riding the entrepreneurship wave of startups in a completely different (and insanely more difficult) context than in Silicon Valley.

I will be writing about our startup and current project [jib.li](http://jib.li)
